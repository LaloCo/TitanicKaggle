# TitanicKaggle

_This is a Practice from the Hands On Machine Learning book by Aurélien Géron using Kaggle and Drive_

## Practicing Machine Learning

The main code, regarding the machine learning models used in the Python notebook, the training and selection
comes from a practice found on Aurélien Géron's book.

## Practicing with Kaggle

The main purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to practice the full flow of entering and submitting results to a competition.
The Kaggle API could be used to submit the resuls, but instead I am saving the csv file ready for upload, at least for the
current example.

Using the Kaggle API I am downloading the train and test data directly from the Kaggle dataset to be used for training the model.

## Practicing GitHub and Drive

As I describe in [this post](https://lalorosas.com/blog/github-colab-drive), working with Drive and GitHub from Colab is not
as straightforward as we may think, so this also worked as a practice for creating a git repo on Drive and adding a GitHub
remote to it.
